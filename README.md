****ProductService Microservice****
**Overview **
ProductService is a microservice built using Java and Spring Boot. This project is designed to demonstrate how to create a microservice using Spring Boot with an emphasis on understanding the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It uses various frameworks and tools including Spring Boot Dev Tools, Lombok, Spring Configuration Processor, REST APIs, RestTemplate, WebClient, JPA-Hibernate, and MySQL.

**Purpose**
The primary goal of this project is to:

Learn how to build a microservice using Spring Boot.
Understand and implement the MVC architecture in a microservice context.
Gain practical experience with Spring Boot's features and integrations.
**Technologies Used**
Java: Programming language.
Spring Boot: Framework for building microservices.
Spring Boot Dev Tools: Provides enhanced development experience with automatic restarts and live reload.
Lombok: Reduces boilerplate code by generating getters, setters, and other methods.
Spring Configuration Processor: Assists with configuration metadata.
REST APIs: For creating endpoints to interact with the microservice.
RestTemplate: For synchronous HTTP requests.
WebClient: For non-blocking, reactive HTTP requests.
JPA (Java Persistence API) - Hibernate: For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and database interactions.
MySQL: Database used for persistence.
MVC Architecture: Model-View-Controller pattern used in project structure.
